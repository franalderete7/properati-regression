# Buenos Aires City Real Estate Dataset Regression
This project is a part of the Acamica Institute in Buenos Aires.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to do a regression in order to predict property prices. This is a continuation of the Transformation project which can be found [here](https://github.com/franalderete7/properati-transformation).

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Project Description
The dataset we'll be working with was extracted from Properati, just like the previus project. The objective here is to predict property prices in USD using the attributes from our dataset. In order to do that, a KNN Regressor and a Decision Tree Regressor will be trained. A major challenge in this project is to get a high R^2 since our dataset was not very clean from the beginning. Besides, some prices are not very accurate.
